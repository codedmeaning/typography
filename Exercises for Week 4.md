# Exercises for Week 4

You’re welcome to start these two exercises on your own, but I will set aside at least an hour in class to work on either or both of these. At the end of the hour, we’ll hold a critique and talk about choices you made, or any obstacles you confronted, technical or otherwise. I encourage you to iterate your ideas across multiple pages or spreads so that you can see the evolution of your thinking. 

The goal of these exercises is not only to give you some practice, but also to help you develop or refine technical skills using your chosen typographical tool. It’s ok if you run into problems or obstacles. But my intention is not to frustrate you—email me if you’re eager to make progress during the week, or wait until office hours or class so that we can go through some of these new ideas and techniques together. There’s no way to do these exercises incorrectly—whatever you produce will represent learning.

We’ve talked briefly about some topics related to punctuation and page layout, but Butterick’s Practical Typography is a great, free resource to learn more or to use as a reference. (https://practicaltypography.com). Pay special attention to the pages on quotes, apostrophes and hyphens/dashes found in the **Type Composition** section; they may help you with the first exercise below. Also, review the section on **Page Layout** which reinforces some of the new ideas introduced in the last class and some broader ideas that we’ve yet to cover.

Consider line breaks, indentation, positioning of elements relative to one another and relative to the margins, letter spacing, line spacing, paragraph spacing, punctuation (or not), justification, alignment, hyphenation, et cetera. Think about parts of your composition that should come forward and parts that should recede. How can you use grays, size, weight, and positioning to achieve that?

In InDesign, you’ll rely on the Character Palette, the Glyph Palette, the Type Tool, text frames, text frame options, and parts of the Paragraph Palette. There’s a lot in the Paragraph Palette, so don’t be afraid to explore and experiment. You can make grays in the Swatch Palette by selecting [Black] and changing its percentage. You may have to Show Hidden Characters (in the Type menu) to handle different types of line breaks. Pay attention to the difference between selecting an entire text frame and selecting specific text *within* the text frame. Don’t worry about threaded text frames unless you really want to. Use Margins and Columns… and Create Guides… under the Layout menu to help with alignment, and don’t forget you can drag rule lines from the page rulers (Show Rulers under the View menu). Notice that there there is usually more than one way through the interface to achieve something—using ribbons, palettes, menus, and keyboard commands. Show needed palettes through the Window menu.

## Exercise 1—Single Page Quote, Short Poem, or Lyrics
Select a quote, haiku, short poem, or lyric that is meaningful to you and set it in type. Be sure to include the quote/poem/lyric itself, its attribution, and a date. It might be more challenging to use a longer text of several lines/sentences, but a single sentence will do. Place your text, attribution, and date onto a single landscape orientation page with dimensions of 8½" × 11". You’ll probably want to create the document as non-facing pages so that you can iterate a few ideas on additionally inserted pages. For color, use only black and percentages of black, focusing more on texture, or the overall “page color”. Avoid making something that looks as if it belongs on Instagram!

You can approach this exercise with an expressive or a practical/technical intent, and then make choices at the typeface, letter, word, sentence, and paragraph levels to reinforce that intent. But you’re not restricted to specific interventions. Experiment with your composing tool—in most cases, InDesign, but you’re welcome to use any tool you have access to. 

## Exercise 2—Book or Article Double Page Spread
Select paragraphs from a favorite book or an interesting magazine article and typeset a double page spread (facing pages). Basically, that’s anything that involves a chapter title, a first paragraph, and subsequent paragraphs. Include other elements, like a subtitle, author, or anything else that might challenge you further. You can use any page dimensions and orientation that you feel is appropriate for your content. Look for actual books or magazine articles (preferably in print) upon which you can model your spread. In fact, it’s often helpful to copy an example to exact specifications—it can help you understand type scale versus page scale and type scale relative other type elements.

Often, books begin a chapter on the *recto* page, that is, the right side of the spread, whereas magazine articles sometimes begin on the *verso* page—the left side of the spread. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recto_and_verso). Either is fine. 

Obtain your text in any way that’s convenient. It could be that the text you’re using doesn’t match the spread design that you’re emulating and that’s perfectly acceptable. You can find text at Project Gutenberg, where you’ll want to download plain text UTF-8 files, or otherwise copy/paste text you find online. You can also use your phone to capture text from an image, or even use Lorem ipsum placeholder text. Again, color, for now, should be restricted to black and percentages of black. And although using imagery beyond typography is tempting, try solving the problem using type exclusively.
