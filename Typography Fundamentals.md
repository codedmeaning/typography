## Topics

### Typography
* Written communication that conveys concepts, information and emotion
* Can be evaluated objectively by considering an artifact's content, intent and audience
* Legibility and feeling can be as fluid as you like, based on your intent


### Typeface vs. font
A typeface: Helvetica. A font: Helvetica Bold. Think of typeface as the “font family”. Its specific weights, widths, and slopes are the individual fonts within that typeface/font family.
* Weights (Thin/bold)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font#Weight

### Helvetica (2006)
You can watch Helvetica for free on Kanopy if you have a San Francisco Public Library card (and likely cards from other county libraries). It’s also available to rent or buy. We watched the clips of Massimo Vignelli and David Carson. The Neville Brody and Rick Poyner clips are from the Extras portion of the DVD, and may not be available for streaming.
