## Topics

### Typography
* Written communication that conveys concepts, information and emotion
* Can be evaluated objectively by considering an artifact's content, intent and audience
* The line between legibility and feeling can be as fluid as you like, based on your intent


### Typeface vs. font
A typeface: Helvetica. A font: Helvetica Bold. Think of typeface as the “font family”. Its specific weights, widths, and slopes are the individual fonts within that typeface/font family.
* Weights (Thin/bold) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font#Weight
* Width (Expanded/wide/narrow/condensed) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font#Width
* Italics/Obliques/Slope https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font#Slope

### Typeface classification—serif, sans-serif, monospace
* Serif, sans-serif https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface#Roman_typefaces 
    * Serif https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif
    * Sans-serif https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif
* Monospaced https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface#Monospaced_typefaces

### Typeface anatomy—lines, heights, and parts
Baseline, x-height, cap-height, ascenders, descenders, counters
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface_anatomy

### Letter spacing
Tracking adjusts spacing between *all* letters while kerning adjusts spacing between specific *pairs* of letters.

## Resources

### Helvetica (2006)
You can watch Helvetica for free on Kanopy if you have a San Francisco Public Library card (and likely cards from other county libraries). It’s also available to rent or buy. We watched the clips of Massimo Vignelli and David Carson. The Neville Brody and Rick Poyner clips are from the Extras portion of the DVD so they may not be available for streaming.

These tools help you work with glyphs outside of Adobe InDesign.
* The macOS Character Viewer helps you find glyphs across fonts and insert them into your text. https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-emoji-and-symbols-on-mac-mchlp1560/mac
* The macOS FontBook allows you to preview all the glyphs included in a font. https://support.apple.com/guide/font-book/welcome/mac
